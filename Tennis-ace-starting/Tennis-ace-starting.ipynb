    "This project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem.\n",

    "#### Project Goals\n",
    "You will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the [Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals) data, you will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world."

While you can head down to your nearest court and aim to overcome your challenger across the net without much practice, a league of professionals spends day and night, month after month practicing to be among the best in the world. Today you will put your linear regression knowledge to the test to better understand what it takes to be an all-star tennis player.\n",
