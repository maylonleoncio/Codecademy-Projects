1. Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project:
Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. Using a formula that estimates a personâ€™s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.

2.Python Functions: Medical Insurance Project
You are curious about how certain factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.
You will apply your new knowledge of Python functions to write a useful function that calculates medical insurance costs.

3.Python Control Flow: Medical Insurance Project
In this project, you will examine how factors such as age, sex, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.
You will apply your knowledge of Python control flow to write code that gives people advice on how to lower their medical insurance costs.

4.Working with Python Lists: Medical Insurance Costs Project
You are a doctor sorting through medical insurance cost data for some patients.
Using your knowledge of Python lists, you will store medical data and see what valuable insights you can gain from that data.

5.Python Loops: Medical Insurance Estimates vs. Costs Project
You are interested in analyzing medical insurance cost data efficiently without writing repetitive code.
In this project, you will use your new knowledge of Python loops to iterate through and analyze medical insurance cost data.
